Connect to the HPIAdmins spreadsheet in the SourceDataÂ workbook.Â 
Hide all of the fields except Date, Region Name, Index and 12m%Change.Â 
Ensure that Date is a Date field, Region Name is a String field, and Index and 12m%Change are number fields.
Rename 12m%Change as "12 month percentage change", and change its default aggregation to Average.
Create a viz (a line chart) which shows, for each RegionName, the average 12 month percentage change per year.
Color the lines according to the RegionName.
Duplicate the viz, and change it to a circle display.
Add the average of the Index as the size.
