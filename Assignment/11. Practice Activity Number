Right - over to you. Close Tableau, if you already have it open, and let's create a couple of vizzes.
Open Tableau, and connect to the Excel workbook "SourceDataf.xlsx", and the Excel spreadsheet "CDs".
Create a viz which shows a bar chart the smallest file size per "File Extension". (There are 3 File Extensions - I want the smallest file size for each of these file extensions.)Â 
Create another viz which shows a line chart with Years and Quarters in the Columns shelf, and the Minimum of the "#" field in the Rows shelf.
Either save this viz to Tableau Public, or save it to your desktop (if you have Tableau Desktop or similar.)
Close Tableau completely, open it again, and open your newly saved file.
