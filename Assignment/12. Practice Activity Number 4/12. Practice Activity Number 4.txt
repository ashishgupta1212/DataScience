1. Connect to the HPIRegions spreadsheet (note: not the HPIAdmin spreadsheet) in the SourceDataf workbook.Â 
2. Create a viz (bar chart) which shows the Year(Date) (going across) by SUM(Sales Volume) (going up). Drag "Region Name" to the Color mark. Rename this as "Viz 1".
3. Create a second viz which has:
Â  Â  "Region Name" on the Rows, and
Â  Â  Sum(Sales Volume) in the Text marks.
Â  Â  Rename this as "Viz 2".
4. Create a third viz which has:
Â  Â  Year(Date) on the Rows shelf
Â  Â  Sum(Sales Volume) in the Text marks.
Â  Â  Rename this as "Viz 3".
5. Create a dashboard which has:
Â  Â  "Viz 2" in the top-left hand corner.
Â  Â  "Viz 3" in the top-right hand corner.
Â  Â  "Viz 1" in the bottom half.
Â  Â  Before you do it, have a think about what is the best order to add the Vizzes into the dashboard.
6. Click on the "Use as Filter" on Viz 2, and click on "East Midlands" in Viz 2. See what happens.
7. Now change this filter so that it only works on a menu.
8. Add a similar filter on Viz 3.
9. Set up this dashboard on a Tablet and a Phone.
10. Create a story, using this dashboard three times. In each story point, select a different region in "Viz 2".
